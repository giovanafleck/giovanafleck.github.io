      <p class="body-text serif">“The Amazon Fund is nothing more than a trick. This allows Norway to put money on a non-profit project and look good internationally”, said the congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro (PSL), son of the president Jair Bolsonaro, in a press conference held in Brasília in July 9th. In that day, the countries that participate on the Mercosul accord - Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile and Bolivia, signed an agreement with te European Union that has been awaited for more than 20 years. </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">The agreement, as reported by Daniela Chiaretti at the Valor Magazine, is a threat to Bolsonaro’s environmental policy. In the past decade, Europe has been investing in conservation. On this years parliament election in May, for the European Parliament, the Greens party won a good amount of chairs. Pressure has being built on Bolsonaro to drop some extreme measures on Amazon and agriculture</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">The end of the Amazon Fund threatens the takeoff of the Mercosur-European Union agreement. The possibility of negotiations around the Fund is bad for the forest and its biodiversity. With the trade agreement, the end of the Fund will also pose risks to agriculture and industry.</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">According to Daniela Weintraub, one of the Fund’s director in Brazil, "the abolition of the Fund is the missing signal for the free trade agreement not to be ratified in European parliaments," and "the Bolsonaro government provides various arguments so that French and German deputies can say that their countries buy deforestation embedded in Brazilian products and boycott the agreement. "
        </p>

      <p class="body-text serif">With the title "Tereza Cristina wants the head of Ricardo Salles in the Environment", Veja magazine published a note informing that the Minister of Agriculture, Tereza Cristina, "recently said to deputies of the Environment Committee that has a better name for Ricardo Salles, if Bolsonaro needs it. " The magazine says that the technician is "connected to the so-called green agribusiness sector, which produces without disrespecting the rules of preservation."
        </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">André Borges reports in the Estadão that the Norwegian Minister of Climate and Environment, Ola Elvestuen, did not accept the proposal of the Brazilian government that changes the management structure of the Amazon Fund. In the official note, Elvestuen says that "from our point of view, the Fund has worked well so far and we are satisfied with our agreement with Brazil. We see no need to change the direction structure of the Amazon Fund. We emphasize that there can be no change in the direction structure of the Fund without the consent of Norway as part of the agreement." It all just sums up inside this context of crisis. </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">"We are concerned about recent developments in Brazil and data on the increase in deforestation in the Amazon." Asked about the Fund, he said that "it would be a step backward if the Fund , which has been an important inspiration for other countries with tropical forests, to end activities. Starting a form of cooperation with Brazil that weakens the foundation of our partnership is not an option. "
        </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Salles insists that it is necessary to "take appropriate measures to further reduce illegal deforestation, but this improvement is, in our view, an improvement in resource management."
          Following his trajectory, Salles will have no recourse to succeed.
          </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">
          The minister sent a "no comment" on Twitter when sharing on Saturday (6/7) a story published in 2014 by Valor Magazine on an initiative, then in studies by the BNDES and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, which "would help ten countries in the Congo Basin monitor deforestation in that region," reports O Globo. It turns out that the project has never been approved, it is not in the portfolio of active projects of the Fund nor between the partnerships canceled.
          </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">According to O Globo, "even if this had happened, it would not constitute any irregularity. This is because the regulation of the Amazon Fund provides for the use of up to 20% of its resources to support the" development of monitoring and control systems for deforestation in other Brazilian biomes and in other tropical countries. "The information is available on the Ministry of Environment's own website."
        </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">The government is looking for an honorable way out to keep the Amazon Fund alive and to save Minister Salles, who was incarnated as an inquisitor of the fire that he himself lit. Ana Carolina Amaral, in Folha, says that the president went to MMA to visit the minister. Also on Monday, German Minister of Economic Cooperation and Development Gerd Müller spoke with Salles and left the meeting saying "it is normal to go through negotiations when there is a new government. The minister reaffirmed his commitment to combating illegal deforestation. "
        </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">On the contrary, prosecutor Leonardo Galiano opened an investigation in the middle of July to examine the Fund. For Fabiano Maisonnave, from Folha, the prosecutor said that "the Amazon Fund is a surplus, resources are not used to the satisfaction. Its implementation has not been done to where the result is obtained, which is environmental inspection, repression and the presence of suitable bodies such as the Federal Police. "
        </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">According to my research, analyzing the Fund’s reports from 2009, year when it was established, and 2018, the beginning of the projects correlate with a decrease in deforestation. According to the Climate’s Observatory, in the 1990s and the begining of the 2000s, deforestation peacked due to a lack of national investiment.  Funded mainly by the European Countries, but also by Brazilian banks and institutions, the Amazon Fund is a REDD+ mechanism created to raise donations for non-reimbursable investments in efforts to prevent, monitor and combat deforestation, as well as to promote the preservation and sustainable use in the Brazilian Amazon.

      <h3 class="section-head serif">How can it be measured?</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">Amazonia has lost nearly 400 square miles of forest in the first 15 days of the month, according to satellite images from Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research. That’s an area bigger than Mount Rainier National Park. It’s the worst level of deforestation a single month has seen since August 2016, but this really didn’t catch anyone by surprise. Bolsonaro has had a clear agenda since taking office: privatize the forest and hand it over to industry.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">There are two major satellites in orbit to monitor the increase of deforestation. Both of them publish regular reports that are available online. This way, the is able government, NGO’s and the population can keep track an visualize what is happening.</p>

      <p class="chart-source"></p>The state that bring awareness is Tocantis, located in the extreme north of Brazil. Known as one of the poorest states, Tocantins struggles with corruption but, also, with a defiant climate. It is the latest hotspot for soy- and cattle-related deforestation. In 2018, more land was cleared there than in any other state of the Brazilian Cerrado, a large tropical savanna biome that covers more than 20 percent of Brazil. Overall Cerrado deforestation rates have declined in recent years, but Tocantins continues to see high rates of forest loss. Soy sourced from Tocantins carries a high risk of being connected with legal and illegal land clearing.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Alongside with Tocantins, is Roraima. Deforestation and forest fires in the Brazilian Amazon are a regional-scale anthropogenic process related to biomass burning, which has a direct impact on global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions. From January to May, Roraima registered 4,600 fires, the most numerous of any state for that period (Roraima saw just 1,970 fires during all of last year). The previous annual record for a Brazilian state was set by Mato Grosso, which suffered 4,927 forest fires in all of 2016.</p>

    <div class="story-body">
      <h3 class="section-head serif">A matter of choice</h3>“There is a need to better radiate the resources to reach smaller forest communities. It is a great challenge to access the Fund and to reach the beneficiaries at the remote communities; it may take several months for a project to be assessed,” said Carlos Koury, executive director at IDESAM, the Amazon Institute of Conservation and Sustainable Development, an NGO established in 2004 and headquartered in Manaus in Amazonas state. He suggests that the Fund should support more creative projects in future, instead of mainly financing initiatives that only offer greater vigilance over illegal deforestation.Vivamus sagittis massa urna, nec condimentum enim tristique at. Mauris a erat quis diam pretium scelerisque a vel dolor. Etiam pulvinar laoreet gravida. Quisque consectetur, arcu non tempor pharetra, tortor massa rhoncus arcu, id vulputate tellus lectus ut elit.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">NGOs say the biggest challenges ahead center around the scaling up and diversification of projects. The Fund, in Koury’s view, should become more “innovative” by better supporting the development of sustainable economies within forest communities. He points out that the Amazon region accounts for only 8 percent of Brazil’s Gross Domestic Product, while covering more than half the nation’s territory. A dramatic shift in GDP to the Amazon is needed he says “in order to create a forest-based economy.”</p>

    <div class="chart-section">
      <p class="chart-title">Where is this happening?</p>
      <p class="chart-subhead"> The Fund helps financing projects that have a great impact on the Forest. Some help exclusively the firefighters that prevent fires, others act to strength indigenous communities and their relation with land owners across the borders of the Amazon. Right now, there are 11 bases of coordination for those iniciatives, which are located mainly in the States where the Forest is placed, but also have a management office in Rio de Janeiro. The projects must be in accordance with applicable public policies as well as the Amazon Fund's guidelines and criteria. Moreover, they should demonstrate their contribution (direct or indirect) to the decrease of deforestation and degradation. The projects´ actions must be consistent with the proposed objectives, with the budget and with the execution timeline. The implementing institution should also have managerial capacity in order to execute the project.
